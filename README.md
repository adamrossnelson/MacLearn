# MacLearn

Repo for testing or demonstrating Machine Learning

## Example using auto2.dta

The dataset `auto2.dta` is available from Stata. Files collected in the the subfolder [auto2dta](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/MacLearn/auto2dta/) are dedicated to using machine learning with the `auto2.dta`. In particular, the goal is to predict if a vehicle is either foriegn or domestic.
